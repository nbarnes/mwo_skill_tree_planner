Mechwarrior Online Skill Tree Planner
============

TECHNOLOGY
==========
Javascript, HTML, and CSS. npm and webpack for builds. Everything it needs, nothing it doesn't. No jQuery!

WHERE
=====
Live builds of the MWO Skill Tree Planner can be found at https://nbarnes.github.io/mwo_skill_tree_planner/. The github repo is at https://github.com/nbarnes/mwo_skill_tree_planner.

BUILD
=====
* Edit your source code, found in `index.html`, the two `.css` files, and, for the javascript, `/src`
* Make sure you have Node.js, and then make sure you have node package manager, then run `npx webpack`
* Your build will be in `/dist` as `main.js`
* Serve your build with the local server of your choice (I use [http-server](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server))
* Visit the served page at `localhost:8080` (port subject to change based on your local server settings)
